# Euromillionen Tipps
## Description
+ There is a _Euromillions.java_ class that creates a certain number of random Euromillions tips. 
+ A tip consists of 5 randomly generated numbers in the range of 1 - 50 (inclusive). 
+ There are also 2 star numbers from the range 1 â€“ 12 (inclusive) for each tip. 
+ In order to determine the number of tips, the current time in the form of milliseconds is used when the program starts. 
+ The digit sum of the milliseconds determines the number of the desired tipsfirmly.
+ Each individual full tip is sorted in ascending order.

Output:
```
Current time in ms: 1678607529659
```
```
Single digits of current time: [9, 5, 6, 9, 2, 5, 7, 0, 6, 8, 7, 6, 1]
```
```
Sum of all digits: 71
```

```
Tipp 1: # [3, 35, 37, 42, 44] * [2, 9]
Tipp 2: # [5, 20, 37, 45, 46] * [1, 3]
...
Tipp 71: # [1, 26, 45, 46, 49] * [5, 10]
```

## Instructions for using the project
The program should be started in a suitable development environment. When the program starts, the current time in milliseconds is used and the tips are generated automatically.


## Further information
The "Euromillion Tips" program was developed by me, Katharina Enzinger, as part of the object-oriented programming course in the second semester of the Business Software Development course.
