# How to insert a Youtubevideo into powerpoint
Embedding a video from a file directly into a PowerPoint presentation is easy, but it also increases the size of the document. 
To avoid this, you can alternatively work with an embed code and, for example, link a video directly from YouTube to your presentation (e.g. YouTube).
You can also play this back as usual during your presentation and the size of your file will not change.
